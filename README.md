# Blazor Web App For Sharing Pokemon Info

## Web application for sharing information about Pokemon. Built with Blazor using .NET 8

I built this application as a way to learn more about using .NET 8 and specifically the Blazor frontend framework.
The application utilizes the [PokeApi]https://pokeapi.co/ to get data about Pokemon.

This application helped me learn about the following Blazor concepts:

* Components
* Data Models
* Clients (for requesting data from an API and then massaging that data into useful information)
* Routing
* Blazor Render Modes (Mostly using the InteractiveServer render mode)
* Creating custom 404 pages and redirecting with status codes using UseStatusCodePagesWithRedirects
